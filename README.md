# User Info
## App Description:
The app simply displays Info for a user from a mock api with an option to delete the user.
## Technical Description:
* The app is structured in MVP.
* My most valuable reference for implementing MVP in android is [Antonio Leiva's Post](https://github.com/antoniolg/androidmvp)
* I've used both Kotlin and Java, usually if working on a new project I would go with Kotlin for most parts but I worte some files in Java to demonstrate how any app can have both and work smoothly (one can maintain a Java written app using kotlin)
* I have used Dagger2 to inject dependencies in the app.
* I have added an android unit test to test the repository, model and presenter layers.
* 3rd party libraries used:RxAndroid 2, Dagger2, Lottie, Hodenhof's circular image view  and Retrofit2.
* A working debug apk for the app can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/b735u12nuzy2l7l/bassem-app-debug.apk?dl=0)
